# Food Smasher — MAE 272 | Spring 2026
Course: MAE 272 – Introduction to Manufacturing Processes
Institution: California State University, Long Beach
Semester: Spring 2026

## Overview
The Food Smasher is a two-component aluminum tool machined entirely from raw stock as part of MAE 272's introduction to manufacturing processes. The project was designed to build hands-on proficiency with standard machine shop equipment — not just following steps, but developing real comfort operating machinery, reading engineering drawings, and holding tolerances on real parts.
## The two components are:
- Handle — turned on a lathe from 1" diameter × 9" length Aluminum 6061-T6 rod
- Smasher Plate (Disk) — milled from 3.5" diameter × 1/8" length Aluminum 6061-T6 disk
- The handle threads into the center of the disk via a ¼-20 UNC threaded hole, forming a complete assembly.

## My Role & What I Actually Did
This project was not handed to me as a CAD file to machine — I was responsible for the full pipeline from physical measurement to final part:
- Measured the reference part using a dial caliper, recording all critical dimensions by hand
- Created a rough dimensioned sketch from my own measurements before touching any software
- Modeled both parts in SolidWorks and produced formal engineering drawings (dimensioned, toleranced, with title block)
- Executed all machining operations on the lathe, milling machine, and band saw
- Verified dimensions using the machine's X, Y, and Z axis readouts to locate features and find part centerlines
